# Embedded ECS Simulator

![ECS Demo](docs/demo.gif)

A **C++17-based simulation of an industrial vehicle Electronic Control System (ECS)** designed to demonstrate common embedded software architecture used in automotive and heavy equipment systems.

This project simulates a simplified **vehicle ECU (Electronic Control Unit)** including system state management, diagnostics, CAN-style messaging, and an operator dashboard.

The simulator is intended as a **demonstration of embedded systems design principles** rather than a full vehicle model.

# System Overview

The simulator models a simplified vehicle control system with the following components:

```

The system runs in a continuous control loop similar to real embedded vehicle controllers.

# Features

### Embedded Control Loop

A real-time control loop updates system state, evaluates diagnostics, and transmits CAN-style messages.

### Finite State Machine

The ECS state machine models typical vehicle operating states:
- OFF
- BOOT
- IDLE
- RUNNING
- WARNING
- FAULT
- EMERGENCY STOP


State transitions occur based on sensor inputs, operator commands, and diagnostics.

```mermaid

    [*] --> OFF

    OFF --> BOOT : Power On
    BOOT --> IDLE : Init OK
    BOOT --> FAULT : Init Failed

    IDLE --> RUNNING : Start Command
    IDLE --> OFF : Power Off

    RUNNING --> WARNING : Non-critical Issue
    RUNNING --> FAULT : Critical Fault
    RUNNING --> EMERGENCY_STOP : E-Stop Pressed
    RUNNING --> IDLE : Stop Command

    WARNING --> RUNNING : Issue Cleared
    WARNING --> FAULT : Fault Escalates
    WARNING --> EMERGENCY_STOP : E-Stop Pressed
    WARNING --> IDLE : Stop Command

    FAULT --> IDLE : Fault Reset
    FAULT --> OFF : Shutdown
    FAULT --> EMERGENCY_STOP : E-Stop Pressed

    EMERGENCY_STOP --> OFF : System Reset / Power Cycle
```

    RUNNING --> IDLE : stop_operation

    WARNING --> RUNNING : warning_cleared

    WARNING --> EMERGENCY_STOP : estop_triggered
    WARNING --> IDLE : stop_operation

    FAULT --> IDLE : reset_fault
    FAULT --> OFF : shutdown
    FAULT --> EMERGENCY_STOP : estop_triggered

    EMERGENCY_STOP --> OFF : power_cycle_reset
```

### Sensor Simulation

The system simulates common vehicle telemetry:

- Engine RPM
- Battery voltage
- Oil temperature
- Hydraulic pressure
- Vehicle speed
- Communication status

### Diagnostics System

A diagnostics engine monitors system conditions and detects faults such as:

- Low battery voltage
- Overtemperature
- Communication failures

Faults trigger warnings, fault states, and simulated CAN messages.

### CAN Communication Simulation

The system simulates transmission of CAN-style messages including:

- System state
- Sensor telemetry
- Active fault codes

### Qt Operator Dashboard

A graphical interface allows interaction with the simulated ECS.

The dashboard provides:

- Real-time telemetry display
- System state visualization
- Operator control inputs
- Fault injection tools

### Fault Injection

Faults can be injected to test system behaviour:

- Low Battery
- Overtemperature
- Communication Failure

This allows testing of diagnostics and system recovery logic.
